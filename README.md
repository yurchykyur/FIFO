# FIFO 
 **First in - First out**
 
This web application is developmented to help generate a tax report for passive investors in fund assets.

The FIFO calculation method is the basis for creating the report. FIFO - first bought, first sold

The idea of creating an application arose as a result of maintaining an excel file in which I recorded trade transactions and based on which I created statements for the tax service for the annual tax report
